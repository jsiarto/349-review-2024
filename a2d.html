  <h2>Commit messages</h2>
  <p>Get in the habbit of being more descriptive in your commit messages. Do not just type giberish into the commit just to get the "push" over with.</p>
  <h2>Handwriting</h2>
  <p>If you are submitting hand-drawn work for projects (work or school), you have to have good handwriting. If you have bad handwriting (that's ok), annotate your sketches digitally. You also need to make sure you are drawing straight lines, and generally making the overall "sketch" look nice.</p>
